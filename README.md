### SkillCraft Data Science Internshipâ€”2025

This repository contains all the tasks that have been completed during my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology. This internship provided experience with real-world datasets and helped in strengthening my understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization.

### Internship

- Organization: SkillCraft Technology
- Duration: 1 July 2025 to 31 July 2025
- Role: Data Science Intern

### Tasks Summary

âœ… Task 01:  Population Distribution Analysis
- Objective: To create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

- Key Activities:
Explored feature relationships such as:<br/>
Population Vs Gender<br/>
Population Vs Age group<br/>
Age ranges from (0-14),(15-64) and (65 and above)

- Tools and Libraries used: Python, numpy, matplotlib, pandas

- Key Visuals Created:<br/>
ðŸ“Š India Population by Gender(2000-2024)<br/>
ðŸ“Š India Population by Age Group and Gender(2000-2024)


âœ… Task 02<br/>
Objective:To perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset and uncover relationships between key variables to identify patterns and trends.<br/>

- Key Activities:<br/>
Loaded and examined the Titanic dataset from Kaggle<br/>
Cleaned the data by:<br/>
 *Dropping irrelevant columns (Cabin, PassengerId, Name, Ticket)<br/>
 *Filling missing values in Age and Embarked using median and mode respectively<br/>
-Performed EDA using Python libraries<br/>
-Created visualizations to explore trends<br/>

- Tools and Libraries used: Python, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib<br/>

- Key Visuals Created:<br/>
  ðŸ“Š Overall survival distribution<br/>
  ðŸ“Š Survival by gender<br/>
  ðŸ“Š Survival by class<br/>
  ðŸ“Š Survival by embarkment point<br/>
  ðŸ“Š Age distribution among survivors<br/>
  ðŸ“Š Correlation heatmap <br/>
  ðŸ“Š Pairwise relationships between key features in the dataset<br/>

ðŸ“ˆ Outcome:<br/>
Through this task, I strengthened my ability to clean real-world datasets, deal with missing and irrelevant data and apply visual EDA techniques to uncover insights and trends. I practiced using correlation analysis and pairplots to examine patterns and improved my data storytelling using clear and purposeful visualizations.<br/>
